<h1> My Pong</h1>

<p>
  Ending, at least for now, this series of game remakes, here it is My Pong
</p>

<h2> What's New</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Animations in the Main Menu </li>
  <li> 2 modes of Playing, Player vs Player or Player vs COM</li>
  <li> Good Screen choice and Resolution </li>
  <li> SoundFX and sliders to control them</li>
</ul>

<h2> Final Considerations</h2>
<p>
  Overall it was a enriching experience, first time dealing with sound effects and also programming a bot to play, definetly skills that I'll bring with me trough my career.

<h2> Game result </h2>
